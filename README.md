# PupParadise

## Project Description

PupParadise is the ultimate app for managing and caring for adorable puppies! Designed specifically for shelter workers, PupParadise is a comprehensive and user-friendly tool that allows you to efficiently track and manage every aspect of the puppies' care, ensuring they receive the love and attention they deserve.

With PupParadise, you can easily organize and maintain detailed profiles for each puppy under your care. You can record essential information such as their breed, age and personality traits. This comprehensive database ensures that you have all the necessary information at your fingertips, enabling you to provide the best possible care for each individual pup.

Feeding time is a crucial aspect of a puppy's routine, and PupParadise simplifies this process by allowing you to schedule and manage feeding times for every puppy. You can set up customized feeding schedules, including meal types, quantities, and special dietary requirements.
